# Who Am I?
Fairly simply paper plugin inspired by the [russian minecraft YouTube videos](https://youtu.be/AVLXdQliCd8&t=2s) (rules also explain in this video)  
where people had guess what minecraft thing (anything) they are.

## How to use?
1. Each player run `/join`
2. After all players joined, OP needs to run `/start`
3. And each player had to name a minecraft thing that other player had to guess.

There is no "Win state" after all players have guessed right, just `/end` or `/restart`

## Commands
- `/addposition` `index` `cordinates`   
Add a position to the game where people will sit on and text display will be created  
Example: ```/addposition 1 ~ ~ ~```

- `/j` or `/join` - Join the game
- `/s` or `/start` - Start the game
- `/e` or `/end` - End the game
- `/r` or `/gamerestart` - Restart the game (`/restart` is already taken by a server)
